                                  Obadiah
                           Chapter Lookup: [20]1
                                      
Chapter 1

   1:1
          The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom;
          We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
          among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in
          battle.
          
   1:2
          Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
          greatly despised.
          
   1:3
          The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest
          in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith
          in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
          
   1:4
          Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy
          nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the
          LORD.
          
   1:5
          If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut
          off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the
          grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?
          
   1:6
          How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
          things sought up!
          
   1:7
          All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
          border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
          thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have
          laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
          
   1:8
          Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
          men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?
          
   1:9
          And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that
          every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.
          
   1:10
          For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
          thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
          
   1:11
          In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
          that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
          foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
          Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
          
   1:12
          But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in
          the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have
          rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
          destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
          day of distress.
          
   1:13
          Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
          the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
          on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid
          hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
          
   1:14
          Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
          those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
          delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
          distress.
          
   1:15
          For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
          hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
          upon thine own head.
          
   1:16
          For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
          heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
          shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
          been.
          
   1:17
          But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
          holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
          possessions.
          
   1:18
          And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph
          a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall
          kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any
          remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.
          
   1:19
          And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and they
          of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the fields
          of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin shall
          possess Gilead.
          
   1:20
          And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
          possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
          captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess the
          cities of the south.
          
   1:21
          And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
          Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S.
