                   THE HOLY BIBLE Authorized Translation
                                   2 John
                           Chapter Lookup: [20]1
                                      
Chapter 1

   1:1
          The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
          the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
          the truth;
          
   1:2
          For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
          us for ever.
          
   1:3
          Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
          from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and
          love.
          
   1:4
          I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
          truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
          
   1:5
          And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
          commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
          beginning, that we love one another.
          
   1:6
          And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
          the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
          should walk in it.
          
   1:7
          For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
          that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
          an antichrist.
          
   1:8
          Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have
          wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
          
   1:9
          Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
          Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
          Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
          
   1:10
          If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
          receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
          
   1:11
          For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
          deeds.
          
   1:12
          Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
          paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
          face, that our joy may be full.
          
   1:13
          The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
