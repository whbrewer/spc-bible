                                  Philemon
                           Chapter Lookup: [20]1
                                      
Chapter 1

   1:1
          Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto
          Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
          
   1:2
          And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and
          to the church in thy house:
          
   1:3
          Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
          Christ.
          
   1:4
          I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
          
   1:5
          Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
          Jesus, and toward all saints;
          
   1:6
          That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the
          acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ
          Jesus.
          
   1:7
          For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
          bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
          
   1:8
          Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee
          that which is convenient,
          
   1:9
          Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as
          Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
          
   1:10
          I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
          bonds:
          
   1:11
          Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable
          to thee and to me:
          
   1:12
          Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
          mine own bowels:
          
   1:13
          Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
          have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
          
   1:14
          But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
          should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
          
   1:15
          For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
          shouldest receive him for ever;
          
   1:16
          Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
          specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
          flesh, and in the Lord?
          
   1:17
          If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
          
   1:18
          If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
          account;
          
   1:19
          I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
          albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
          own self besides.
          
   1:20
          Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
          bowels in the Lord.
          
   1:21
          Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
          that thou wilt also do more than I say.
          
   1:22
          But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
          your prayers I shall be given unto you.
          
   1:23
          There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
          
   1:24
          Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
          
   1:25
          The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
          
  Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus a servant.
