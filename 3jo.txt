Chapter 1

   1:1
          The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
          
   1:2
          Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
          be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
          
   1:3
          For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of
          the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
          
   1:4
          I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
          truth.
          
   1:5
          Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
          brethren, and to strangers;
          
   1:6
          Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom
          if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou
          shalt do well:
          
   1:7
          Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
          nothing of the Gentiles.
          
   1:8
          We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
          fellowhelpers to the truth.
          
   1:9
          I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the
          preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
          
   1:10
          Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,
          prating against us with malicious words: and not content
          therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and
          forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.
          
   1:11
          Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.
          He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not
          seen God.
          
   1:12
          Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:
          yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is
          true.
          
   1:13
          I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
          write unto thee:
          
   1:14
          But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
          to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
          friends by name.
